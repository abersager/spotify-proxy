## üéØ Setup Process (All Methods)

After deployment, regardless of method used:

### 1. **Create Spotify App**
- Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
- Create a new app
- Note your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
- Add callback URL: `https://your-worker-name.your-subdomain.workers.dev/callback`

### 2. **Complete Web Setup**
- Visit your deployed worker URL
- Enter your Spotify credentials in the web form
- Click "Connect Spotify Account" to authorize
- Test your endpoints!

### 3. **Start Using Your Proxy**
- `/now-playing` - Current track
- `/recent` - Recently played tracks
- `/health` - Status check

## üîß Development

To run the development server locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The worker will be available at `http://localhost:8787`

## üõ† API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `/` | Home page with links to setup and endpoints |
| `/setup` | OAuth setup GUI |
| `/callback` | OAuth callback (don't call directly) |
| `/now-playing` | Current track and playback state |
| `/recent` | Recently played tracks (last 10) |
| `/health` | Health check and configuration status |

### Example Responses

#### `/now-playing`
```json
{
  "is_playing": true,
  "item": {
    "name": "Song Name",
    "artists": [{"name": "Artist Name"}],
    "album": {
      "name": "Album Name",
      "images": [{"url": "https://..."}]
    },
    "external_urls": {
      "spotify": "https://open.spotify.com/track/..."
    }
  },
  "progress_ms": 45000,
  "device": {
    "name": "Device Name",
    "type": "Computer"
  }
}
```

#### `/recent`
```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "track": {
        "name": "Song Name",
        "artists": [{"name": "Artist Name"}],
        "album": {"name": "Album Name"}
      },
      "played_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## üîê Security

- OAuth tokens are stored securely in Cloudflare KV
- Client credentials are stored as Cloudflare Workers secrets
- All API calls are server-side to prevent credential exposure
- CORS headers are properly configured for web applications

## üìñ Configuration

The worker uses the following environment variables:

- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` - Your Spotify app's client ID (secret)
- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` - Your Spotify app's client secret (secret)
- `ENVIRONMENT` - Environment name (set in wrangler.toml)

## üîë Getting Cloudflare Credentials

For deployment, you'll need:

### 1. **Cloudflare Account ID**
- Go to [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com)
- Copy your Account ID from the right sidebar

### 2. **API Token**
- Go to [API Tokens](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens)
- Click "Create Token"
- Use "Edit Cloudflare Workers" template
- Select your account and zone permissions
- Copy the generated token

## üõü Troubleshooting

### Deployment Issues

1. **"Invalid API token"** - Regenerate your Cloudflare API token with proper Worker permissions
2. **"Account ID not found"** - Double-check your Account ID from Cloudflare dashboard
3. **"Worker name conflict"** - Choose a different worker name during deployment

### Setup Issues

1. **"No valid tokens found"** - Complete the credential setup at `/credentials` first
2. **"Invalid Client ID format"** - Ensure you're using the correct Spotify Client ID (32+ characters)
3. **"Callback URL mismatch"** - Ensure your Spotify app's redirect URI matches your worker's `/callback` endpoint
4. **"OAuth failed"** - Check your Spotify credentials and callback URL configuration

### Getting Help

- Check the `/health` endpoint for configuration status
- Look at the browser console for any error messages
- Verify your Spotify app settings match your worker URL
- Ensure your worker has the latest code deployed
